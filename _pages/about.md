My research is centered around single-cell RNA-seq, genomics, transcriptomics, machine learning, bioinformatics tool development, and computational breeding. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of being mentored by [Prof. Kun Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kun-Lu-15) during my undergraduate studies at [Southwest University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) in China (2019-2023).

Auguest 2025 I have awared Master degree of Science in Bioinformatics at  [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

During Januray to July 2025 I have joined [The Institute for Experiential AI Northeastern University](https://ai.northeastern.edu/) as a Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Co-Op, under the supervision of [Dr. Ayan Paul](https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/ayan-paul) and [Dr. Arzu Tugce Guler](https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/arzu-tugce-guler), where I will focus on building ETL pipelines for multi-omics data, developing Python and R tools for data analysis and post-processing, and creating machine learning models with explainability measures in XAI.
