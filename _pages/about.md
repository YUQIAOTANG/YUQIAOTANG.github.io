# Hello
I'm Yuqiao Tang, a graduate student in the [Interdiciplinary Graduate Program in Genetics and Genomics](https://genetics.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University. 

My research focuses on single-cell RNA-seq, genomics, transcriptomics, machine learning, bioinformatics tool development, and computational breeding. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Southwest University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) in China (2019-2023), where I was mentored by [Prof. Kun Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kun-Lu-15).

In August 2025, I have be awarded a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

From January to July 2025, I have joined [The Institute for Experiential AI Northeastern University](https://ai.northeastern.edu/) as a Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Co-Op, under the supervision of [Dr. Ayan Paul](https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/ayan-paul) and [Dr. Arzu Tugce Guler](https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/arzu-tugce-guler), where I will focus on building ETL pipelines for multi-omics data, developing Python and R tools for data analysis and post-processing, and creating machine learning models with explainability measures in XAI.
