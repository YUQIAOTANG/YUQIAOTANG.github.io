excerpt: 'In this study, 50 BnHIR genes in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) were identified and categorized into four groups, which play crucial roles in resistance against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Subcellular localization predictions suggest these HIR proteins are predominantly located in the mitochondria, and their promoters contain cis-acting elements related to light and various abiotic stresses. Notably, upon S. sclerotiorum infection, the BnHIR genes in Groups 1, 3, and 4 showed strong induction, especially those in Group 1 which exhibited distinct expression patterns, and overexpression of BnHIR2.7 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary relationships of HIR family genes in B. napus and establish a foundation for their role in resistance mechanisms against S. sclerotiorum.'
